- XGBoost objective and split gain formula 
- Satellite preprocessing and time‑series feature engineering code blocks

- Satellite archive table: S1 1,847; S2 3,254; VIIRS 36; SRTM 124 → total 5,261 scenes, 847 GB 

## Business impact (number marquee + contribution bars)

## Data sources & citations (accordion list)

- Satellite: Copernicus S1/S2, NOAA VIIRS, NASA SRTM
- Health: DGHS, WHO

## Files to import into the template

- JSON primary source: DASHBOARD_DATA_COMPLETE.json (put under /public/data or fetch at runtime) 
- CSVs for charts:
  - KPI_SUMMARY.csv 
  - MODEL_COMPARISON.csv 
  - TRAINING_TRENDS.csv 
  - API_USAGE_TRENDS.csv 
  - DEMO_CARDS.csv 
- Narrative MD: TECH-CODEX-DASHBOARD.md (render in an MDX/Markdown section) 

## Suggested component wiring (pseudo JSX)

- KPI Ticker: stream values from KPI_SUMMARY.csv with auto‑scroll and color states 
- Area/Line Charts: import TRAINING_TRENDS.csv and API_USAGE_TRENDS.csv; animate on mount 
- Spotlight Cards: hydrate from DEMO_CARDS.csv with status pill (PRODUCTION/DEVELOPMENT) 
- Model Table: sortable + parameter sparkbars from MODEL_COMPARISON.csv 
- Narrative: render TECH-CODEX-DASHBOARD.md with code blocks and inline badges 
- Number Marquee: read cost_savings_usd, uptime_pct, api_requests_monthly from JSON and animate count‑up 

## QA checks completed

- Numeric consistency across JSON/CSV/MD is aligned (accuracy, MAPE, R², MAE, cost, scenes) 
- Duplicated values abstracted into JSON to avoid drift; CSVs mirror key subsets for quick visual components 
- Script/architecture details included as expandable technical narrative, not only charts/tables 
- All datasets and timelines present with targets and statuses for visual storytelling 

If you want, a zip of these dashboard files can be packaged and the template’s demo pages scaffolded with pre-wired imports.
